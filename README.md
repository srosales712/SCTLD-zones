This repository contains data and code for the study titled "Stony coral tissue loss disease results in persistent microbial-level disturbances on coral reef ecosystems."
The data/ directory includes the associated metadata and compressed files of taxonomy and ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) counts. Analysis code is provided as Python notebooks, allowing outputs to be viewed alongside the code. If notebooks do not render properly on GitHub, you can view them using nbviewer.
